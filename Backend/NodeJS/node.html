$node -> We use this command to enter the node REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop) - when we type something in (like 5+8) we will see that Node will:
1. Read the code (look at it)
2. Evaluate the code ("understand" and execute it)
3. Print the code (it will print the number 13 for the given example)
4. Loop - we are able to run more code again and again and again
