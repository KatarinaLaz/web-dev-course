Whole separate section in the course for learning Bootstarp

Bootstrap is a framework - meaning it's external. Grid and Felxbox are build into CSS, but the Bootstrap Framework is not

Bootstrap is a 12 division system - if the full width of the website can be divided into 12 equal portions (columns)

When we resize the website, the potrion widths are automatically resized as well - his is great for responsivenes and makes styling easier
