Types of selectors:

1. Tag selector - html, a, p, img (html { color: blue;}) - targets all elements of a certain tag

2. Class selector - .class_name (.red-text {color: red;}) - a class is an attribute that we can add to any element - we use this to group elements and apply changes to all of them
<h2 class="red-text">Heading</h2>
<p class="red-text">Paragraph</p>

3. Id selector - #id (#main {color: green;})
<h2 id="main">Heading</h2>

4. Attribute selector - p[attribute or attribute value] (p[draggable] {color: red;}) or (p[draggable:"true"] {color: red;}) - select all paragraph elements with the attribute draggable
<p draggable="true">Drag me</p>          all elements with the draggable attribute       all elements that have the draggable attribute and it has a "true" value

5. Universal selector - * (* {color:"red";}) - applies the style to everything where the stylesheet is active

Difference beyween id and class selector - class is applied to many elements, while id should only be applied to one element in a single html file (class) - id should be completely unique
