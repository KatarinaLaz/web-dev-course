<body>
<h1 style="color: blue">Style Me in Blue!</h1>
</body>

</html>

<!-- 
Goes into the same line as the html element 
Example:

<html style="background: blue"></html>

-------------------------

"style" => attribute
"background" => property
"blue" => value of the property

------------------------
Inline is not recommended for general use as there is no reusability
It's used for:
- Testing
- When we want to change a single element only
- When we want to change a small section only
- When we want to change one line only
