Properties:

* order - set on container child(ren) - by default is "0" - we can give elements a specific order to rearrange them on the screen
- bigger number goes to the right for "row" and down for "column"

* flex-wrap - set on container - by default is "nowrap" 0 - when the width of elements is bigger than the width of the screen it will be pushed to the end (right),
off screen and will not go into the next line - this is also not responsive, the more we shrink the screen,
the more items are pushed off screen and the user won't be able to see them - we can use the "wrap" option to
move elements that don't have enough space on the same line onto the next line

* justify-content - set on container - by default is "flex-start" - everything is bunched up to the left - sets the distriubution of content across the main axis

* align-items - set on container - by default is "flex-start" - sets the distibution across the cross axis - the height of the container needs to be set and have space
-- DOES NOT WORK WITH flex-wrap: wrap; --
Example:

align-items: flex-end;
height: 60vh; - vh = viewport height (the window that we're viewing the page on) - 100vh is 100% of the viewport

* align-content - only works with "flex-wrap: wrap" - set on container

* align-self - set on container child(ren) - if we want an element in a container to have a different alignment from the other, we need to set it's align-self property
to what we want it to have - makes the item separate from the group
