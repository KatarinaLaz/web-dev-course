When we have a style conflict, for example: An element has an inline style, but there is also an external style afecting it

---------------------------

"Index.html"

<ol>
  <li style="colorL red">One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ol>

"styles.css"                                 - In a case like this, the inline style will take precedence over the external style and that one list item will be red, while the other will be green

li{
  color:green;
}
----------------------------

Hierarchy:

- Position - this is also part of the hierarchy - this overrides none

  Example 1 - two conflicting rules withing one rule set: 
    li {
      color: red;                     applies red first, but then the green overrides the red - final result is green
      color: green;
    }

  Example 2 - two conflicting rule sets:
    li {
      color: red;
    }

    li {
      color: green;                   applies red first, but then the green overrides the red - final result is green
    }

---------------------------

- Specificity - this is also part of the hierarchy - this overrides Position

<li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable>

li { color: blue;}                - element selector - least specific - overrides none
.first-class {color: red;}        - class selector
li[draggable] {color: purple;}    - attribute selecotr (some say that this is the same level as class, but most of the time it will override the class styles)
#first-id {colorL orange;}        - id selector - most specific - overrides all

---------------------------

- Type - this is also part of the hierarchy - this overrides Position and Type

1. External style - looks at this first (style.css)
2. Internal style - looks at this second and overrides any conflict with External styles (<style></style>)
3. Inline style - looks at this last and overrides any conflict with External or Internal styles (style="")

---------------------------

- Importance - this is also part of the hierarchy - this overrides Position, Type and Specificity

This utilizes the !important keyword

color: red;
color: green !important; - ensures that his will be the most important rule relative to that element - none of the other hierarchy rules can override this
