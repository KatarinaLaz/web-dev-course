Positioning examples:
https://appbrewery.github.io/css-positioning/

1. Static positioning - the default one, default html positioning and behavior

  - When we add another item it goes to the bottom of whatever previous element there is

  position: static; - we don't really need to apply this, it is applied by default

2. Relative positioning - relative to its default position (static postition) - takes the default position and allows us to apply changes to it's position

  position: relative;
  left: 50px; - moves it 50px to the left relative to the default position (this would have no effect if position was static)
  top: 50px;  - moves is 50px to the bottom relative to the default position (this would have no effect if position was static)

3. Absolute positioning - position is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor - if there is no positioned ancestor it gets positioned relative to the top left corner of the webpage

 -When an element has the Absolute position it is taken out of the original html flow and put into a separate layer - we are able to change its Z-Index to put if in front of
 or behind the html flow elements (if it has a Z-Index of 0 it will still go in front of the html flow), but it can't be a part of that flow

  For example: We have box1 and box2. Box2 is a smaller box inside box1. Box1 has a relative position.
               Box2's absolute position will be relative to box1's position, not to its default (static) position

4. Fixed positioning - relative to the top left corner of the browser window (not webpage) - this means even if we scroll up and down on the webpage, it will still be positioned 
relative to the browser (scrolling doesn't make it go away - we can't scroll past it)

--------------------------------------------

Z-Index - determines which elements go on top of which - higher Z-Index goes in front of lower Z-Index elements
Default Z-Index is 0 of all elements

--------------------------------------------

If we look at the box model we can see that the position is outside of the margin box, meaning we can also add margins to positioned elements
