To set the Default shell when opening the console we go to View -> Command Pallete -> enter "Select default profile" -> click on it and choose a profile


If the operating system is a pistachio - the Kernel (nut) is the program that interfaces with the hardware (CPU, Disk, Memory) - it is the core of the operating system
                                       - the Shell is the UI that we use to interact with the Kernel - there are 2 types

                                       1. GUI (Graphical User Interface) - like the windows explorer window that we use to access and find files
                                       2. CLI (Command Line Interface) - an alternative way of interfacing with the Kernel


BASH shell (Bourne Again SHell) - a CLI for the UNIX system (Linux, MacOS 10 (Unix Like operating system)) - CLIs give us greater control

$ls - lists all folder and files inside the directory we are in
$cd (change directory) - go into a different folder inside the one that you are already in - we can also chain folder $cd folder/folder1/folder2 to get to where we want
$cd ~ - goes back to root
$cd .. (space between cd and ..) - exits the current folder and goes into the parent folder

pwd - gives us the absolute path to the folder that we are currently in

You are able to click inside the Bash shell only if you're holding the ALT key
CTRL + A - selects the start of the line
CTRL + E - selects the end of the line
CTRL + U - deletes the whole line



DIRECTORY AND FILE MANIPULATION:


mkdir {name} - creates a folder with a specified name
touch {name of file.extension} => touch Text.txt - creates a file with a specific name and extension

*Windows - start {file name} => open Text.xt - opens a specific file with the default program for the type of file
*Mac - open {file name}

*Windows - code Text.txt - "code" specifically opens the file in Visual Studio Code instead of the default one
*Mac - open -a {application} {file} => open -a /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app Text.txt - we can open a file with a specified program instead of the default one

rm {file name} => rm Text.txt - used fo remove a single file inside the directory
rm * - remove all files from the directory

rm -r {directory name} => rm -r MyDocuments - remove a directory from the current directory

rm -rf - same as rm -r but doesn't need confirmation (f is for force)

--no-preserve-root/ - wipes the hard disk to a point that makes it unrecoverable - NEVER USE THIS

sudo (super user do) - uses admin privileges
